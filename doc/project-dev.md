### Extensions for Flutter and Dart

- [Turn On: Dart:Preview Flutter Ui Guides]('https://dartcode.org/releases/v3-1/#preview-flutter-ui-guides')
I suggest you go in the settings and enable the Dart:Preview Flutter Ui Guides option. That will make it really easy to spot the parent-child relationships in your code, which is particularly useful when you have many nested widgets in your UI files.
